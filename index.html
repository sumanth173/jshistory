        <h2>Features of Js.</h2>
        <li>
          Dynamically Typed Language : Without mentioning data type we can
          assign the variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Object-Oriented-Programming : We use only three
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Functional Programming : Follows functional way of programming -
          follows call back , higher order and closure function's.
        </li>
        <li>
          First-Class Function : Function in Js are first class because , they
          can be pass an arguments and returns another function and can store in
          data structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prototype-Based-Inheritance : Used this type of inheritance , where
          objects inherits properties from this prototype.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <h2>Web Development Features.</h2>
        <li>DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model).</li>
        <li>Event Handling (Clicking(Scrolling/Hovering)).</li>
        <li>Fetch API/HTTP requests (To integrate API's).</li>
        <li>
          Web Storage - Access only by Js (To store data
          temporarly(loclal/session/cookies)).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h2>Modern Features.</h2>
        <li>Async/Await.</li>
        <li>Promises.</li>
        <li>Classes (Objects).</li>
        <li>Modules (Piece of code).</li>
        <li>Typescript (Mentions Data types).</li>
        <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</li>
        <li>Error Handling.</li>
        <li>Regular expression (Data type in Js).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Free like structure of html/css that is called DOM , to change the
          branches of that free, we should use Js.
        </li>
        <li>
          Async/Await and Promises - are used when we do Asynchronous
          operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          JSON - Famous object notation used in interchanging the data between
          the 2 systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Error Handling - Continues flow even we get error's in middle of
          lines.
        </li>
        <li>Variable - To store the data/value or information.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h2>Things to follow in Variable is :</h2>
        <li>Declaration - Will contains the name for the variable.</li>
        <li>Assigning - Assign the value.</li>
        <li>Intialisation - Doing declaration of assignment at a time.</li>
        <li>
          Types of Variable's:
          <ol>
            <li>Var.</li>
            <li>Let.</li>
            <li>Const.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <h2>Difference between undefined and not defined in JavaScript :</h2>
        <li>
          In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a
          very simple difference between them. If the variable name which is
          being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be not
          defined, and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any
          value till now, then it would be undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Undefined : It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning.
          Everything which gets a space in memory will contain undefined until
          we assign a value to that memory space.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript code is being executed in two-phase :
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>
              The first one is the memory allocation phase during this all the
              variables and function definitions get stored inside the memory
              heap. The JavaScript assigns undefined to each variable in this
              phase.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second one is a thread of the execution phase, during this the
              code written inside the JavaScript file is being executed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Each variable holds the value undefined till the program reaches the
          line where we have assigned that variable. After that line, the
          variable’s undefined value gets replaced by the original value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not defined: In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that
          JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not
          inside the memory heap.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <h2>
          Variable declaration in JavaScript follows certain rules and
          guidelines :
        </h2>
        <li>
          Declaration Types : JavaScript has three ways to declare variables:
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>var (old and less preferred)</li>
            <li>let (block-scoped, preferred for most use cases)</li>
            <li>const (block-scoped, for constants that don't change)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Variable Naming Rules :
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>
              Alphanumeric and Underscores Only: Variable names can contain
              letters, numbers, $, and _. They cannot contain spaces or special
              characters.
            </li>

            <li>
              Cannot Start with Numbers: Variable names cannot begin with
              digits.
            </li>
            <li>
              No Reserved Keywords: Variable names cannot use JavaScript
              reserved words like class, var, let, const, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Case-Sensitive: Variable names are case-sensitive.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoping Rules :
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>
              var: Function-scoped or globally scoped (does not respect block
              scope).
            </li>
            <li>let and const: Block-scoped.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hoisting :
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>
              var: Declared variables are hoisted to the top of their scope and
              initialized as undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              let and const: Declared variables are hoisted but remain in a
              "temporal dead zone" until their declaration is encountered.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Best Practices :
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>Use const by default for variables that won't change.</li>
            <li>Use let when the variable needs to be reassigned.</li>
            <li>Avoid using var unless maintaining older code.</li>
            <li>Always use descriptive, meaningful variable names.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
